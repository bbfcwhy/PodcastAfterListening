To create a new feature specification:

1. Look for existing feature branches to determine the next available number.
2. Run `/.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh` with the feature description.
3. Read the generated `spec.md` template.
4. Fill in the specification details based on the user's input, following `courses/speckit/specify` guidelines.
